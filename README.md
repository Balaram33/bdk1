In this folder, there are input files (excel), code (python), and output files (figures). 

1. To create the Budyko plots for different temporal scale (30, 20, 10, 5, 3, 2, and 1 years) for a specific basin (here Luni river basin), python code is provided.

   This code (Budyko temporal cariation all basins.ipynb) will help get plots for any number of climate change scenarios (here three). For example, an input excel file (luni.xlsx) can be used to get the Budyko plots for the Luni river basin. For each of the temporal scale (e.g., T years), we will get a plot as a figure named as "LRB_budyko_Tyears.jpeg".
   
3. To create a matrix plot of dots with temporal scale limit.

   The code (temporal_limit_dotted.ipynb) will help to get the matrix plot of temporal scale limit under different climate change scenarios. The input file (temporal_limit.xlsx) can be used to get the output figure (PRB_temporal_limits_dots.jpeg).
